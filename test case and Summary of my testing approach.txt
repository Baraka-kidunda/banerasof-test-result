Summary of my testing approach

Functional Testing Strategy Summary

1. Scope of Testing
Focused on key user flows:
- Authentication: login and registration
- Search: querying valid and invalid movie titles
- Playback: verifying smooth streaming and access control
- Watchlist: adding and removing movies

Each test includes:
- Test name Login With Valid Credentials
- Reproduction steps
- Expected vs actual outcomes
- status (with warning indicators or failure notes)

2. Test Case Design
- Followed structured templates: Test Name, Steps, Expected vs Actual Result, Status
- Used clear, behavior-driven naming like Login With Valid and invalid Credentials`

3. Best Practices Applied
- Isolation: each test runs independently
- No logic replication: expected outputs are hardcoded
